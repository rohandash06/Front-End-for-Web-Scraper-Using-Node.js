							<h1>Continental</h1>
							<h2>Trust in us. Leading car experts do.</h2>
							
								
						</header>
						<p>Continental understands that the safety, comfort and performance of a vehicle is paramount to any driving experience. After all, the tyres that are fitted onto your car play a crucial role in how it handles on the road. If you want to secure the best driving experience, without compromising safety or quality, get on the road with Continental Original Equipment tyres.</p>
						<h3>Best in braking</h3> 
						<h4>Continental is the premium tyre brand you can trust</h4>
						<p>Continental understands the roads of the world -- and how a car tyre should brake safely on them. Continental Tyres are a premium brand that delivers reponsive braking in all weather conditions, whether you're a driver who needs a summer tyre for dry tarmac or a set of winter tyres for grip in colder conditions.</p>
						<h3>Our vision for now and the future.</h3>
						<p>As one of the most trusted brands in the automotive industry, Continental has introduced some essential technologies for safer and more comfortable driving. We invented the first tread tyre pattern in 1904, after all.

But our expertise extends beyond the tyre. Today we're at the vanguard of automotive technology, for example developing 360-degree vehicle cameras and connective cruise controls. At Continental, we’re not just providing the fastest way to the perfect tyre. We're helping mould the future landscape for the entire car.  

The Continental Automotive Group is one of the world's leading automotive suppliers with over 87,000 employees in more than 170 locations. We work in a unique setup from tyres to advanced safety systems with one shared vision: making mobility safe, sustainable and interconnected.

As cars grow more intelligent and provide more data, we have three dedicated divisions which leverage this information to enhance the driving experience further. Continental covers the entire process of driving a car – and maybe one day, we'll see our technologies driving vehicles independently.</p>
